I use typespec to generate a c# application. A change has been made to the typespec and I want to see if I need to make changes to my c# application. Below is the type spec files that have been changed or added:
<typespecfiles>


These are all of the names of my existing application files that have been generated from the typespec. Which of these files do you think I might need to update or do add? 
<appfiles>

Give your response as json in the format below. I need to parse your repsonse as json so no examples, header or footer. Please do not include "```json" at the top or "```" at the bottom. 
The files should match the paths given above. For example if a new controller is needed it should be listed as living in the controllers path. Remeber that I have provided a list of existing application files so none of those should appear under filesToAdd. filesToAdd holds the list of file that did not appear in the application files list that you think will need to be created.
{
    "filesToAdd":[
        "C:\\Dev\\TecmoTourney\\Orchestration\\PlayerTournamentOrchestration.cs",
        "C:\\Dev\\TecmoTourney\\Orchestration\\PlayerTournamentOrchestration.cs"
    ],
    
    "filesToUpdate":[
        "C:\\Dev\\TecmoTourney\\DataAccess\\Interfaces\\ITournamentsDAO.cs"
    ];
}


Here are some tips:
-  if you think a model needs to be updated then the DAO model will need to be updated too
